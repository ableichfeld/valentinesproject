<p class="profileGraf">On April 7, 2021, third-year studio art major Emily Wagner looked around Golden Gate Park in San Francisco for someone with long, curly hair and an orange bike, hoping she would spot the blind date that her friend Karina set her up with. When they met up, they grabbed gyros and walked on the beach — Wagner decided to pursue this relationship. </p>
<p class="profileGraf">Three months later, they stopped seeing each other because Wagner’s long-term partner came home for the summer — she had been in an open relationship, which ended in November 2021.</p>
<p class="profileGraf">In the summer of 2021, Wagner re-downloaded dating apps on her phone after not using them for a while. She looked for flings and made sure to be upfront about her desires. To spark conversation, Wagner put on her Tinder profile: “I have seven vibrators and zero regrets.”</p>
<p class="profileGraf">As someone who is open about her sexuality, Wagner was disappointed that people in Boston were not. She found that her profile stirred up better conversation in San Francisco than in Boston and she had fewer Tinder matches in Boston.</p>
<p class="profileGraf">“I feel more accepted sexually in San Francisco,” Wagner said. “Here [in Boston] when I talk about [sex], people are a little off put.”</p>
<p class="profileGraf">In fact, when Wagner told a man she was casually seeing from Tinder that she was in an open relationship, he was not accepting of it. Wagner recalled him telling her that what she was doing was “dirty.”</p>
<p class="profileGraf">“I felt really ashamed and embarrassed,” Wagner said.</p>
<p class="profileGraf">Wagner has found dating to be difficult, especially on dating apps — not only because she is queer, but also because she is particular about the people she pursues. From her experiences on dating apps, Wagner learned to be forward about what she is looking for and what her boundaries are.</p>
<p class="profileGraf">“In queer relationships, I think communication of wants and desires is so important and that intimacy for me is built by being in person,” Wagner said.</p>
<p class="profileGraf">Even though Wagner believes that it’s easier to have genuine connections with people outside of dating apps, she does believe that dating apps are beneficial for those who do not go to parties often, like herself.</p>
<p class="profileGraf">“We as humans are just masters at creating tools to make our lives easier,” Wagner said. “[But] like most tools — it doesn’t work for everybody.”vAlthough Wagner likes dating apps less than she used to, she would defend those who use them any day. One of the biggest benefits of dating apps, she said, is the convenience of the large pool of candidates.</p>
<p class="profileGraf">“There’s [so many] fish in the sea,” Wagner said. “If you want [a] fish, are you going to get [it] individually or use a net?”
